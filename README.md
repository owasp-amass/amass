## Installation [![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/owasp-amass/amass)](https://golang.org/dl/) [![Docker Images](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/caffix/amass.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/caffix/amass) [![GitHub Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/owasp-amass/amass/latest/total.svg)](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/releases/latest)

> You can find some additional installation variations in the [Installation Guide](./doc/install.md).

### Prebuilt Packages

1. Simply unzip the [package](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/releases/latest)
2. Put the precompiled binary into your path
3. Start using OWASP Amass!

#### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap owasp-amass/amass
brew install amass
```

### Docker Container

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
2. Pull the Docker image by running `docker pull caffix/amass`
3. Run `docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ caffix/amass enum -d example.com`

The volume argument allows the Amass graph database to persist between executions and output files to be accessed on the host system. The first field (left of the colon) of the volume option is the amass output directory that is external to Docker, while the second field is the path, internal to Docker, where amass will write the output files.

### Building the "amass" binary from source on the "develop" branch

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and setup your Go workspace
2. At this point, the binary should be in `$GOPATH/bin`

The amass_engine must be built first as it is embedded within the "amass" project
3. Extract the amass_engine source code, e.g.:
    git clone {engine repository or fork}
    cd engine
    git checkout develop
 
4. Build the amass_engine
    cd cmd/amass_engine/
    go build
    go install

5. Extract the amass source code, e.g.:
    git clone {amass repository or fork}
    cd amass
    git checkout develop

6. Copy the amass_engine binary where it's needed:
    cp ~/go/bin/amass_engine resources/.

7. Build the amass project:
    cd cmd/amass
    go build
    go install

## Testimonials

### [![Accenture Logo](./images/accenture_logo.png) Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/)

*"Accenture’s adversary simulation team has used Amass as our primary tool suite on a variety of external enumeration projects and attack surface assessments for clients. It’s been an absolutely invaluable basis for infrastructure enumeration, and we’re really grateful for all the hard work that’s gone into making and maintaining it – it’s made our job much easier!"*

\- Max Deighton, Accenture Cyber Defense Manager

### [![Visma Logo](./images/visma_logo.png) Visma](https://www.visma.com/)

*"For an internal red team, the organisational structure of Visma puts us against a unique challenge. Having sufficient, continuous visibility over our external attack surface is an integral part of being able to efficiently carry out our task. When dealing with hundreds of companies with different products and supporting infrastructure we need to always be on top of our game.*

*For years, OWASP Amass has been a staple in the asset reconnaissance field, and keeps proving its worth time after time. The tool keeps constantly evolving and improving to adapt to the new trends in this area."*

\- Joona Hoikkala ([@joohoi](https://github.com/joohoi)) & Alexis Fernández ([@six2dez](https://github.com/six2dez)), Visma Red Team
